# CLIMB-COVID Acceptable Use Policy

Use of the CLIMB-COVID system is bound by:
* The conditions of the COG-UK Consortium Agreement.
* The overall [CLIMB Big Data Acceptable Use Policy](https://discourse.climb.ac.uk/t/climb-big-data-terms-and-conditions-for-users-may-2020/1236)
* Your employer's own acceptable use, security and data management policies.

Depending on your role in the consortium, you will be able to contribute data and / or access data collected by COG-UK for analysis. **You must comply with these policies at all times when carrying out your work for the consortium.** COG-UK has been able to assemble a rich dataset to allow research into SARS-CoV-2. Our continued ability to do this depends on everyone using this appropriately.

The key requirements are summarised below but it is your responsibility to familiarise yourself with the relevant policies. If in doubt please read the [documentation](https://docs.covid19.climb.ac.uk/), speak to your site lead or email [COGUK_DataAccess@medschl.cam.ac.uk](mailto:COGUK_DataAccess@medschl.cam.ac.uk).

## Key requirements for use of CLIMB-COVID

### Uploading data
*	You must not upload any data that directly identifies an individual.<sup>1</sup>
*	You must ensure that you have permission to share data with the consortium before uploading it to CLIMB-COVID.<sup>2</sup>
*	You must follow the instructions for uploading data available from the [COG-UK Docs](https://docs.covid19.climb.ac.uk/) site.

### Use of data
*	You may only use data made available through CLIMB-COVID to support the work of the COG-UK consortium. Where you are granted access to restricted datasets they may only be used for the approved purpose.<sup>3</sup>
*	You may not download metadata classified as as ‘consortium access’ or ‘restricted access’ from CLIMB-COVID. (See [classification of data items](data-classification)). Analysis of consortium or restricted access data must be conducted on CLIMB-COVID.<sup>4</sup> For clarity:
    *	You may download the results of your analysis, but must take appropriate care that there do not include consortium or restricted access data items and do not pose a risk of re-identifying an individual. If in doubt, please contact [COGUK_DataAccess@medschl.cam.ac.uk](mailto:COGUK_DataAccess@medschl.cam.ac.uk).<sup>5</sup>
    *	Sequences and a small number of variables (`central sample ID`, `adm1` and `date of sample collection / receipt`) are placed in the public domain and may be analysed locally.<sup>6</sup>
*	You must have completed data protection training within the past year and must provide evidence of this to COG-UK team (see details of appropriate training below).<sup>7</sup>
*	You must keep the data confidential. You may not share or allow others to access COG-UK data.<sup>8</sup>
*	You must not try to identify any individual in the COG-UK data in CLIMB-COVID or link this to other datasets that may lead to identification of an individual.<sup>9</sup>
*	You must notify [COGUK_DataAccess@medschl.cam.ac.uk](mailto:COGUK_DataAccess@medschl.cam.ac.uk) of any unauthorised or accidental access, use or disclosure of COG-UK data as soon as reasonably practicable.<sup>10</sup>
 
### Publication of results
*	You must comply with the COG-UK publication policy [Link], including the requirements for authorship, Steering Group review and funder acknowledgement.<sup>11</sup>
*	In particular, all outputs must comply with the [Anonymisation Standard for Publishing Health and Social Care Data](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/isb1523-anonymisation-standard-for-publishing-health-and-social-care-data).<sup>11</sup>
 
Use of CLIMB-COVID is monitored and failure to comply with these policies may lead to your access being withdrawn.<sup>12</sup>
 
 
### Acceptable forms of data protection training
Acceptable forms of data protection training for accessing COG-UK data are:
1.	Your employer's data protection or information governance training.
2.	[NHS Information Governance Training - Data Security Awareness Level 1](https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/data-security-awareness/) for those with NHS contracts.
3.	[MRC e-learning: : Research, GDPR and confidentiality – what you really need to know](https://byglearning.co.uk/mrcrsc-lms/course/view.php?id=71).

You must provide evidence that you have completed one of these to [COGUK_DataAccess@medschl.cam.ac.uk](mailto:COGUK_DataAccess@medschl.cam.ac.uk) to use CLIMB-COVID.
